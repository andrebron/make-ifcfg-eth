make-ifcfg-eth
==============

This bash loop script facilitates creating up to a full /24 (or less) of ifcfg-eth0:$ interface configuration scripts for yum distributions.

It will create all the scripts sequentially from the first script as xxx.yyy.zzz.### up to one full /24

VARIABLES MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED TO SUIT YOUR NEEDS.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER / CAVEATS:  

USING THIS SCRIPT INCORRECTLY CAN OVERWRITE INTERFACES.  THIS IS SPECIALLY TRUE WITH AN OS WITH MORE THAN ONE INTERFACE SCRIPT FOR eth0 (ifcfg-eth0:1, ifcfg-eth0:2, etc)

TO AVOID THESE ISSUES, YOU CAN MODIFIY THIS SCRIPT'S 'ifcfg-eth0:$1' TO USE 'ifcfg-eth0:0:$1' OR 'ifcfg-eth0:zzz:$1' WHERE 'zzz' IS THE 3rd OCTECT OF YOUR /24.

DIRECTIONS:

THIS USAGE IS ONLY FOR AN OS WITH 1 INTERFACE SCRIPT FOR 'eth0' ALSO KNOWN AS 'ifcfg-eth0'

1. YOU MUST REPLACE THE ### IN THE BASH FOR LOOP WITH THE HIGHEST /24 FOURTH OCTET OF THE IP RANGE
2. YOU MUST ADD YOUR FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD OCTECTS OF YOUR /24 REPLACING xxx.yyy.zzz WITH THE CORRECT VALUES.  
3. YOU MUST ALSO REPLACE aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd WITH THE FULL GATEWAY.

DIRECTIONS:

THIS USAGE IS FOR AN OS WITH MORE INTERFACE SCRIPTS ALREADY CREATED FOR 'eth0' ALSO KNOWN AS 'ifcfg-eth0:1' AND/OR INTERFACE SCRIPTS

1. YOU MUST REPLACE THE ### IN THE BASH FOR LOOP WITH THE HIGHEST /24 FOURTH OCTET OF THE IP RANGE
2. YOU MUST MODIFIY THIS SCRIPT'S 'ifcfg-eth0:$1' TO USE 'ifcfg-eth0:0:$1', A VARIATION OF THIS, OR 'ifcfg-eth0:zzz:$1' WHERE 'zzz' IS THE 3rd OCTECT OF YOUR /24.
3. YOU MUST ADD YOUR FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD OCTECTS OF YOUR /24 REPLACING xxx.yyy.zzz WITH THE CORRECT VALUES.  
4. YOU MUST ALSO REPLACE aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd WITH THE FULL GATEWAY.

ENJOY!
